# willisMD Community Edition

A cross-platform markdown editor with live preview and advanced editing capabilities, built with Electron and React.  You might ask why create another markdown editor?  While there are a lot of editors out there, I didn't find one that was fully open source, multi-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) that I really liked.  I wanted simple file browser and markdown editing with multiple tabs and live preview and an option to auto save and use basic templates.  So I used Anthropic Claude to help create it.

willisMD Community Edition is open source and built as a passion project, but if its useful to you, consider throwing a few dollars our way as a donation to continue support of the open source edition.

My major future focus will be on willisMD Pro, a professional edition with more advanced feature that will be a commercial product.  If willisMD Community Edition meets your needs, I am delighted.  The willisMD Pro edition will be released in comming months with the same base, but expanded features.  More details soon.
