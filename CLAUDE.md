## Development Commands

- `npm start` or `npm run dev` - Run the application in development mode (starts both webpack dev server and Electron)
- `npm run dev:renderer` - Run only the React development server
- `npm run dev:electron` - Run only the Electron app
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production (both renderer and Electron)
- `npm run build:renderer` - Build only the React app
- `npm run build:electron` - Package the Electron app with electron-builder
- `npm test` - Run tests (test framework not yet configured)

## Release Process

When creating a new release:
1. Update version in `package.json`
2. **IMPORTANT: Update version in `/public/About.md` (line 3: "## Version X.X.X")**
3. Update the "What's New" section in `/public/About.md` with release notes
4. Commit changes with version bump message
5. Create and push git tag: `git tag vX.X.X && git push origin vX.X.X`
6. GitHub Actions will automatically build and attach artifacts to the release

## Architecture Notes

1. **IPC Communication**: The app uses contextBridge in the preload script to expose safe APIs to the renderer process. All file operations go through IPC channels.

2. **State Management**: Currently using React state in index.js. The application manages complex state including tabs, preferences, and editor modes.

3. **Markdown Processing**: Using the `marked` library for markdown parsing with DOMPurify for sanitization.

4. **Advanced Editor System**: 
   - **CodeMirror 6**: Professional text editor with full markdown syntax highlighting, line numbers, code folding, and advanced features
   - **Unified Experience**: All users get the same powerful editing experience

5. **Export Functionality**: 
   - Supports HTML, PDF (via puppeteer), EPUB, and DOCX exports
   - Theme-aware exports: All export formats use the currently selected preview theme
   - Main process override: Exports read theme directly from saved preferences to ensure consistency
   - Embedded theme CSS in main process for production compatibility

6. **Theme System**: 
   - Comprehensive theming with CSS custom properties supporting 10 different themes
   - Themes available: Standard, Modern, Manuscript, Business, Informal, Academic, Technical, Minimalist, Classic, Report
   - Live preview updates when switching themes
   - Theme selection persists across sessions
   - All exports respect selected theme
